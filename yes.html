      <h1>Hehehehe, I knew it! ðŸ˜˜ From the first moment I saw you, I knew my life would never be the same. Our love was a rare and beautiful thing, but sometimes, love alone isn't enough.

        Even if we may not end up together, I want you to know that my love for you will never fade. Until my last breath, I will carry you in my heart. The memories we've shared will be my solace, a reminder of what could have been.
        
        I promise to love you forever, even from afar. You will always be the love of my life, and I will cherish our time together until the end of my days.
         I will always love you, my zikra (z)</h1>
